## Text Editors
A text editor is a piece of software that allows you to write and manage text, especially in coding languages such as html.

 Your text editor will be one of the most important tools you have as a web developer. As you will spend lots of your time coding inside your text editor, it is important to choose the right one. When choosing a text editor, you should be looking for the following qualities:

 1. Code Completion - This is the feature that allows you to start typing something and your text editor will give you suggestions of what you can enter.

 2. Syntax Highlighting - This is when certain syntax elements will be highlighted in different colours making them much clearer to read.

 3. Themes  - the ability to customise the view of your text editor can be very helpful for increasing readability and reduce eye-strain

 4. Extensions - Choosing a text editor that has a large variety of helpful extensions can be a game changer
