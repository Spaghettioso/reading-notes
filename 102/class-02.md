## Text Editors
<br>



A text editor is a piece of software that allows you to write and manage text, especially in coding languages. A few examples include such as markdown, html, css and javascript.

 Your text editor will be one of the most important tools you have as a web developer. As you will spend lots of your time coding inside your text editor, it is important to choose the right one. When choosing a text editor, you should be looking for the following qualities:

 <br>

 1.  **Code Completion**  - This is the feature that allows you to start typing something and your text editor will give you suggestions of what you can enter. For example, if you are trying to reference something in your code like another document, you can only type the first few letters and the text editor will offer a list of options with those letters.

 2. **Syntax Highlighting** - This is when certain syntax elements will be highlighted in different colours making them much clearer to read. This makes code much easier to understand as you can see what each piece of a command is doing by how it is coloured. For example, in VS Code using javascript, a string will be highlighted in orange.

 3. **Themes**  - the ability to customise the view of your text editor can be very helpful for increasing readability and reducing eye-strain.

 4. **Extensions** - Choosing a text editor that has a large variety of helpful extensions can be a game changer. extensions can add a whole range of functions to your text editor and can be used for anything from ease of use to hosting a live version of a web page you created. Extensions are key in helping you code more effectively and more efficiently.

A very popular code editor is an editor called "Visual Studio Code" or VS Code for short. This is the code editor that is recommend by online coding course porivder "The Odin Project" and is also the suggested text editor for your current coding bootcamp course run by Tech Educators.

VS Code is currently the preferred choice for new developers working with web development languages such as html, css, javascript and Node.js as it's free, easy to use, works with multiple coding languages and has many extensions as well as an active community who are constantly updating and adding new extensions.

## The Command Line
<br>
The Command Line, also referred to as the 'Terminal' is a text-based interface system that, essentially, allows you to things on the computer via 'commands' done by entering prompts into the command line. Usually your are given feedback also in the form of text in the command line, but entering commands can also do other things, for example launching/running another programme.

<br>

Something like a Windows or Mac PC will, by default, use somethin called a 'GUI' or Graphical User Interface. As the name suggests, the user 'interfaces' with the system by interacting with graphics e.g. clicking on a folder to enter that folder. GUIs are seen as the most beginner-friendly/intuitive types of user interface, but are much less efficient and powerful than a text-based user interface like the Command Line/Terminal.

<br>
Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you. There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell. You can find out which shell you are running by typing the command "echo $SHELL" into your linux terminal. For your coding bootcamp, you are running zshell.

<br>

When using the terminal, you can also navigate and edit your file system. Here are a list of common commands you will use to do this:

* **pwd** - This means "Print Working Directory" which will display the current directory you are in
* **ls** - this stands for "list" and will list all of the files and directories inside your working
     directory (be aware that ls wont show all files and you may need to use "ls -a" instead)
* **cd** - This stands for 'change directory' and is how you navigate to another directory by putting the command, a space and then the name of the folder you wish to move to. Be aware that if the directory you wish to move to is outside of your working directory, you will need to take absolute/relative file paths into account
* **mkdir** - this stands for "make directory" and makes a directory. Be aware that if you create duplicate directories it may remove the original along with any files inside it.
* **rmdir** This is used for removing directories, but it wont work unless the directory is empty. be very careful when removing directories as this can do a lot of damage and break stuff unless you are careful
* **rm** this is the command used for removing individual files.
