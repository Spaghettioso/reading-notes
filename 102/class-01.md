# What is a Growth Mindset?

Personally, I believe that a growth mindset is the idea that you can significantly improve *how you learn* and *how well you learn*  
through changing your thoughts and beliefs and how you view learning to cultivate a love of learning. 

A growth mindset is in contrast to a fixed mindset, which sees things like intelligence and talent as fixed traits that cannot be improved.  
It suggests that success comes from inherent qualities alone without the need for further development or effort.

### How can you maintain a Growth Mindset?

- Always maintain a positive point of view and make sure that any criticism is constructive rather than destructive
- Take things one step at a time - There may be tough days when everything seems overwhelming so focus only on the next step  
 because **the most important step you can take is the next one**
- Try to avoid comparing yourself to others - everyone is at a different stage in their coding journey so to compare yourself  
to someone who is ahead of you is setting yourself up for failure

> Comparison is the thief of joy.
