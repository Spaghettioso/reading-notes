### About

This page is going to be the main area where I store my notes for the Tech Educators MERN stack coding bootcamp. I'll refer  
back to these notes throughout the course to keep my knowledge up to date on all aspects of the course.  

There is also a short introduction about myself and also a section for explaining what having a 'Growth Mindset' is and how to  
maintain a growth mindset.



### Introduction

Hi my name is Johnny and I am a student on the Tech Educators full MERN stack coding bootcamp course. I'm 29 years old and before  
starting this coding course I  had a job in an IT Helpdesk which I had been doing for the last for the last 8 months. Previous to  
that I've spent most of my career working in Customer Services for local governments. 

My hobbies include:
- Video Games
- Running
- Reading Sci-fi books
- Dungeons and Dragons
