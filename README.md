### About

This repo is going to be the main area where I store my notes for the Tech Educators MERN stack coding bootcamp. I'll refer  
back to these notes throughout the course to keep my knowledge up to date on all aspects of the course.  

There is also a short introduction about myself and also a section for explaining what having a 'Growth Mindset' is and how to  
maintain a growth mindset.

### Introduction

Hi my name is Johnny and I am a student on the Tech Educators full MERN stack coding bootcamp course. I'm 29 years old and before  
starting this coding course I  had a job in an IT Helpdesk which I had been doing for the last for the last 8 months. Previous to  
that I've spent most of my career working in Customer Services for local government. I'm a huge video game nerd and love  
everything fantasy and sci-fi.

My hobbies include:
- Video Games
- Running
- Reading Sci-fi books
- Dungeons and Dragons

Also, here is an image of an axolotl because I think they're cute:

### What is a Growth Mindset?

Personally, I believe that a growth mindset is the idea that you can significantly improve *how you learn* and *how well you learn*  
through changing your thoughts and beliefs and how you view learning to cultivate a love of learning. 

A growth mindset is in contrast to a fixed mindset, which sees things like intelligence and talent as fixed traits that cannot be improved.  
It suggests that success comes from inherent qualities alone without the need for further development or effort.

### How can you maintain a Growth Mindset?

- Always maintain a positive point of view and make sure that any criticism is constructive rather than destructive
- Take things one step at a time - There may be tough days when everything seems overwhelming so focus only on the next step  
 because **the most important step you can take is the next one**
- Try to avoid comparing yourself to others - everyone is at a different stage in their coding journey so to compare yourself  
to someone who is ahead of you is setting yourself up for failure

> Comparison is the thief of joy.
